\section{Approach}
This section presents our approach to refactoring the application code based on schema change in four steps, which are schema change extraction, query extraction, inconsistency detection, and patch generation \shan{``solution generation'' sounds strange}. Some code snippets will be utilized as examples which are mainly from Rails applications. But similar APIs and usage exist in Django applications as well.
