\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}
This section discusses how \ETool conducts inconsistency checking and refactoring
step by step, based on the source code of 
two versions of an application.
Unless specially explained,
the code analysis is based on
AST trees generated by Yard \cite{yard} for Rails
 and 
pyast \cite{pyparser} for Django programs.
