\section{Conclusion}
\seclabel{conc}
Database-backed web applications are widely used and often built using ORM frameworks. We conduct a comprehensive study to understand how well such applications perform and scale with the data they manage. By profiling the latest versions of 12 representative ORM applications and studying their bug-tracking systems, we find 9 types of ORM performance anti-patterns and many performance problems in the latest versions of these applications. Our findings open up new research opportunities to develop techniques that can help developers solve performance issues in ORM applications.
