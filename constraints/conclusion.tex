%DB-backed web applications maintain a huge amount of persistent data. 
Specifying and maintaining
consistent and suitable constraints for data is crucial to ensure the application correctness and usability.
In this paper, we thoroughly studied how data constraints have been specified, maintained, and led to
real-world issues in 12 representative open-source DB-backed applications. Our study shows that
tooling support is needed to help developers manage data constraints, and our checker is the first step towards providing such support.
