It is increasingly challenging to develop web applications that can deliver both good functionality and desired performance. We present \Tool, a tool that
helps web developers explore the performance-functionality trade-off space
in their web application design. The \Tool estimator provides developers 
with data-processing cost information for every HTML tag that renders
dynamically generated data, while the \Tool optimizer identifies and automates
view-changing refactoring that can greatly improve performance.
The \Tool interface integrates estimator and optimizer together to enable effective web application design.
