Threats to the validity of our work could come from multiple
sources. 
\textbf{Internal Validity}: The HTML tags that are dynamically generated through JavaScript can not be detected or analyzed by \Tool. \textbf{External Validity}: The 12 applications in our benchmark suite may not represent all real-world applications; The synthesized databases may not represent real-world workloads; The machine and network settings of our profiling may differ from real usersâ€™ setting; the 100 participants of our user-study from MTurk may not represent all real-world users. Overall, we have tried our best to conduct an unbiased study.
