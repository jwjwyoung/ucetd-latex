\Tool is a new tool that automatically detects and fixes a large set of 
ORM-related performance issues that are both common and severe in database-backed
web applications. Its integration with RubyMine provides an easy way for
Rails developers to avoid making performance-degrading mistakes in their
programs. We have used \Tool to identify and fix many performance-related issues in real-world applications, and will extend \Tool tackle further performance anti-patterns as future work.
